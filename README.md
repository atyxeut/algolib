## About

This repository contains a header only template library that requires at least C++11 to compile (for MSVC, at least C++14).

Compiler extensions are employed, but compatibility is still ensured (for GCC, Clang, and MSVC). It is safe to consider that the code conforms to the C++ standard, if you only use it with GCC, Clang and MSVC.
