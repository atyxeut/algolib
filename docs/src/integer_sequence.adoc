= src/integer_sequence.hpp

Backports C++14 `std::integer_sequence` and its helpers, and provides custom helpers.

== Required includes

Custom headers: `src/aliases.hpp`.

== Content

=== Backports
All the interfaces defined by the standard library are available, just replace the `std::` qualification with `aal::`.

The implementation details are learned from link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/integer_sequence.html[here].

=== Custom helpers

==== `aal::make_integer_sequence_from_1` and `aal::make_index_sequence_from_1`

Similar to `std::make_integer_sequence` and `std::make_index_sequence`,
but the sequence is `1, ... , N` instead of `0, ... , N - 1`.
